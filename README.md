# Loan-Payback

Loan Payback Identification

These are publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Investors would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying loan back. The model was created to predict this.

Data were from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. You can download the data from this link https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action. The NA value has been cleaned before applied to this project.
